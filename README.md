## Final words

In 2022, I caught one more star than in 2021!
Despite having begun on time, due to some other emergencies to manage, I could'nt find the time to solve the puzzles. The three ones I completed were coded with  [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

This Advent of Code 2022 in Rust was however really fun to do this with my colleague and friend [@rene-d](https://github.com/rene-d). Next year, I hope to go a little bit further.
